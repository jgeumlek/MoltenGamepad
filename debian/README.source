moltengamepad for Debian - notes about the source package
-----------------------

* This package is based on the sources found here
  https://github.com/mbenkmann/MoltenGamepad  branch "msb"
  https://github.com/mbenkmann/MG-Files       branch "msb"
  
  These repositories include the debian/ directory.

* The .orig.tar.xz package is auto-generated by executing debian/make-orig
  from within a checkout of the git repository. It parses the debian/changelog to
  find the latest version and converts that into a tag or date to use with git archive.
  
  The debian/ directory itself is excluded from this archive via .gitattributes file.

* 2 types of package version are supported by make-orig:
  * a git tag (e.g. "v1.0.0")
  * a date in the form YYYY.MM.DD
  
  Both forms may optionally be followed by a -suffix.
